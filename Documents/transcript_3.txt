 i'm going to quickly talk about how to  do arithmetic with complex numbers such  as how to  add two complex numbers subtract complex  numbers multiply divide  two complex numbers  it's this one is fairly easy you may  have seen this before but let's say we  have two complex numbers z1  which is a plus  sorry a1 plus j times b1  and z2  is a2 plus j times b2 and let's say  that's the cartesian representation for  z  and let's say we also have the polar  representation for z  as r1 times e to the  j theta 1.  and  let's say that  z2 is r2 times e to the j theta 2.  so how do you add two complex numbers  z1  plus z2  you would simply add the real parts and  you would simply add their imaginary  part and so the real part of z1 plus z2  becomes  k1 plus b1  i'm sorry a1 plus a2 sorry  a1 plus  a2 plus j times b1 plus b2  and in the same way you can subtract z2  from z1  by simply  subtracting the real parts and the  imaginary parts and so we can say z plus  or minus  z1 plus or minus z2 is a1 plus or minus  a2  plus j times b1 plus or minus b2  and  multiplying two complex numbers how do  you multiply z1 and z2 together  well we can  use the cartesian form  and simply multiply  these two complex numbers  and if you do that you're going to get  and then you can collect the real parts  together and the imaginary parts  together but notice what you're going to  you're going to get a1 times a2  plus j times  a1 times b2  plus j times  b1 times a2  plus  j times b1 times j times b2  right but j times j is the same as  negative one  so you get  minus b1 times b2  so these two terms together form the  real  part of this so you the real part  becomes a1 a2  minus b1 times b2 plus j times  a1 b2  plus b1 times a2  okay  however  it will be much easier for you to  multiply two complex numbers using their  polar representation so if that's an  option for you i think you should  certainly consider that because that's  going to be a lot easier when you  multiply  z1 and z2 using their polar  representations you're going to get  r1 times e to the j1 theta 1 times r2  times e to the j theta 2  which gives you  r1 times r2  times e to the j  theta 1 plus theta 2.  so what this means is  the magnitude of z1 times z2  is nothing but  the product of r1 and r2 which is the  magnitude of z1 times the magnitude of  z2  now the angle of z1 times z2  is the sum of the angles of z1 and z2  okay  so it's a lot easier to multiply complex  numbers using their polar forms  the same thing is going to be true  if you try to divide two complex numbers  now  let's try to make some space here  and talk about  how to divide two complex numbers  dividing two complex numbers is quite  painful if you try if you do them  directly in their cartesian form i mean  it's doable and you probably  have done arithmetic with complex  numbers  before  uh  so if we want to divide  z1 by z2  then we have in cartesian form we have  a1  plus j times b1 divided by a2 plus j  times b2  right and if i want to write the result  of z1 over z2 in cartesian form which  means i want to write it as a real part  plus j times the imaginary part then  it's not obvious how to get the real  part and the imaginary part from this  and the standard or one way to do this  is  to multiply  the numerator and denominator by the  complex conjugate  of  z2  and  the the product of these two  if you try to multiply them out  you will see that this is this becomes  just a square of the magnitude of z or  this becomes a squared plus b squared  particularly the imaginary terms cancel  out so notice that you get a j times b 2  times a 2 from here you get a negative j  times b 2 times a 2 from here and so  they both cancel out and you get a  squared plus b squared and the nice part  is that this is strictly a real number  right so in the numerator you know  you're going to get the product of these  two so you're going to get  a1 times a2  plus  b1 times b2  and  you're going to get  plus j times  b1 a2  minus a2 b1  but dividing this complex number by the  real number is pretty easy because you  just divide the real part by this real  number and the imaginary part by this  real number so the answer then  simply becomes a1 a2 plus b1 b2  divided by a2 squared plus b2 squared  plus j times  okay  now again you know i would  not i would try to avoid doing this kind  of lengthy calculations  if at all possible and one way you can  avoid it is to think of the polar  representations for z1 and z2  now  the polar representation for z1  tells you that z1 can be written as r1  times e to the j theta 1 and z2 can be  written as r2 times e to the j theta 2.  then z1 over z2 is simply  r1 times e to the j theta 1 over r 2  times e to the j theta 2  and this is r 1 over r 2 times e to the  j theta 1 minus theta 2.  so  here is where you really are using  the  power of euler's formula and the polar  representation  you can see that this is just so much  simpler to do and and notice that these  e to the j theta ones and e to the j  theta two they follow exactly the same  arithmetic as  e raised to some real numbers  right so it's e to the j times theta 1  minus theta 2  it becomes the  or the phase becomes theta 1 minus theta  2 the angle becomes theta 1 minus theta  2 and the magnitude becomes r1 over r2  so the magnitude  of z1 over z2  is is the same as the as the magnitude  of z1  divided by the magnitude of z2 which is  r1 over r2  and the angle  of  z1 over z2 is theta 1 minus theta  you
