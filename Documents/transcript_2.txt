 in this video i'm going to talk about  what is called as euler's formula  this is perhaps one of the most used  formulas in this course  and it's one of the most useful formulas  when dealing with complex numbers  and the formula essentially says  that  if you take a complex number of the form  cosine theta plus j times sine theta  this  can be thought of  as  e to the j times theta  now i'm going to go ahead and prove this  but before i go ahead and do the proof i  want to talk a little bit about  how you are going to likely use this  formula in the course  and  the thing is you know if you look at  this quantity called e to the j times  theta  that's a very confusing quantity  right because what does it mean to raise  e  to a power which is complex  there seems to be no operational meaning  to this it doesn't seem to be a quantity  that is easy to explain as saying you  know this is what you are doing to e  when you raise e to a power j times  theta  and in fact  i'll i'll try to show the proof and  maybe some things will become clear when  we do that  but  the way we are going to typically use  euler's formula in this course  is to realize that if you have a complex  number of the form cosine theta plus j  times sine theta  and you want to do algebra with these  complex numbers if you want to multiply  two complex numbers together you want to  divide two complex numbers  things like that this complex number can  be treated as e to the j times theta  where  e to the j times theta  obeys the typical algebra that you see  with exponentials so  to give you a more concrete example  if you had let us say two complex  numbers say let's say i have a complex  number cosine theta one  plus j times sine theta one let's call  this complex number  as z1 and let's say i have another  complex number z2 which is cosine theta  2  plus  j times  sine theta 2.  and let's say we wanted to multiply  these two  together now you can clearly multiply to  them together but you will see that you  know you get cross terms you have to  collect all the real terms together  collect all the  imaginary par terms together so on and  so forth  but  what euler's formula tells you is this  you can think of this complex number  as e to the j theta one  and you can think of this as e to the j  theta two and if you wanted to multiply  z one and z2 together  this is simply e to the j times theta 1  times e to the j times theta 2  and here we can use the rules of  multiplying e raised to j theta 1 times  e raised to j theta 2 and we can write  this as e to the j times theta 1 plus  theta 2  which when you convert back to cartesian  form is cosine theta 1 plus theta 2  plus j times  sine  theta 1 plus theta 2.  so you can see how easy it is to  multiply these two complex numbers if  you use euler's formula  all right that is the operational way in  which we will use euler's formula  okay  all right so  euler's formula also tells us  that  if i re if i let me write dollars  formula here again e to the j theta  is cosine theta  plus j times sine theta  so if i replace  theta by negative theta  then we get e to the negative j theta  is cosine  of negative theta but cosine of negative  theta is the same as  cosine theta  plus  j times sine of negative theta  and sine of negative theta is the same  as negative sine theta right so  this  becomes negative  sine theta  so now from these two you can see that  if i add these two equations together  we're gonna the the sine theta terms are  going to cancel out and we are going to  get 2 times cosine theta on the right  hand side  so e to the j theta  plus e to the negative j theta  is 2 times cosine theta  or equivalently  one half  of e to the j theta  plus e to the negative j theta  is cosine theta  oops  and in the same way if we subtract this  equation from  the other  i'm going to get 2 times j times sine  theta on the right hand side so i'm  going to get 2 times j times sine theta  on the right hand side  and that is equal to e to the j theta  minus e to the negative j theta  so if we divide both sides by  by two j  we get sine theta on the right hand side  and we get  one over two j  so these two formulas also turn out to  be really useful  in simplifying expressions  you know you may end up with complicated  expressions where you may have a bunch  of terms which are the form e to the j  theta and e to the negative j theta and  if we use the fact that  e to the j theta plus e to the negative  j theta  over two is cosine theta we can  substantially simplify these things  okay so this is how we are typically  going to use euler's formula in this  class and now let's go to the proof  of why  cosine theta plus j times sine theta can  be thought of as e to the j times  theta  to prove that let's quickly go back and  recall something that you have learned  in your freshman calculus class  now we know that these trigonometric  functions cosine theta and sine theta  have series expansions  so this serious expansion is the taylor  series expansion for cosine theta around  theta equal to 0 it's also called as a  maclaurin series expansion for cosine  theta so it tells you that cosine theta  is 1 minus theta squared over 2  factorial plus theta to the 4 over 4  factorial so on and so forth  and it tells you that sine theta  is theta minus theta cubed over 3  factorial plus you see all the odd  powers of theta in sine and all the even  powers of theta in cosine  and in the same way there is also a  series expansion for e to the theta  the series expansion for e to the theta  is that it's 1 plus theta plus theta  squared over 2 factorial plus so on and  so forth you have all the powers of  theta and you don't have any  negatives in the coefficients  right and in fact  i think this series expansion is the  best way to think about  what it means to raise e  to some power so for example what is the  meaning of e to the some irrational  number let's say pi for example  right one way to think about it is to  say that e to the pi for example is  nothing but a short form  for the power series that you would get  by replacing theta with pi  or  e to the square root of 2 for example  would be e to the  would be a short form for what you get  by replacing theta by square root of two  right so in that same way if you think  of it that way  then  we can think of e to the j theta as the  short form  for what you would get in the power  series  by replacing theta by j times theta  right so when i do that  what we're going to get is we're going  to get e to the j theta to be 1  plus j times theta  plus j theta squared  over 2 factorial  plus j theta cubed  over three factorial  plus j theta to the four  over four factorial  so on and so forth  right  okay  now let's try to split  this into its real and imaginary parts  so notice that the first term is real  the second term  is strictly imaginary  now the third term which has j theta to  the power of two  right what is j times theta squared  that's j squared times theta squared and  j squared is nothing but negative one so  the third term is actually  my is is negative of theta squared over  two factorial  and do you see what you have here you  have exactly 1 minus theta squared over  2 factorial  and now if you look at the fourth term  here you're going to get j times theta  to the 4 divided by 4 factorial  now what is what is theta to the  4 i'm sorry j times theta to the 4  that's j to the 4 times theta to the 4  but j to the 4  is 1.  and so if you if you collect all the  real terms you're going to get exactly  the series expansion for cosine theta so  you're going to get 1  minus  i'm going to try to use a different  marker  and then  let's look at let's collect all the  imaginary terms together  we they're going to have a  a common factor j so let's factor that  out so then we're going to get j times  this term is going to give you a theta  now notice this term is going to give  you a j times j squared times theta cube  and j squared is nothing but negative 1  so you get  theta cube over 3 factorial and you're  going to get theta to the 5 over 5  factorial minus so on and so forth  and indeed the first term is exactly the  taylor series expansion of cosine theta  and  the second term is exactly the taylor  series expansion of  sine theta so this tells you that e to  the j theta is equal to cosine theta  plus j times sine theta which is exactly  what euler's formula says  okay now  i went through the proof just to show  you where this comes from  but we're not really going to use a lot  about the proof in the class  and i really do want you to  get comfortable  with  this number called e to the j theta you  know initially this is a number that's  very confusing to people right because  you're taking e and you are raising it  to some complex number  and it's not clear what that means  and the best way to think about that is  to say that is a representation of the  complex number cosine theta plus j times  sine theta that is all it is it is just  one way to write this complex number but  writing it this way helps you do some  arithmetic with it and hence it's useful  to think of this number  in terms of an exponential  form and that's exactly what euler's  formula  gives you  okay  now a special case of euler's formula  let's try to erase this  let's think about what happens to  euler's formula  when theta is equal to pi  when theta is equal to pi euler's  formula tells you that e to the j times  pi  is cosine pi  plus j times sine pi  and you know that sine pi is zero and  cos n pi is negative one  right so it tells you that e to the j pi  is equal to negative 1  or e to the j pi  plus 1  is equal to 0. so this is just a special  case  of euler's formula when theta is equal  to pi sometimes it's called as euler's  identity  and  you can you know this is such a  simple and elegant formula right you  know it has some  fundamental constants in mathematics  that come in many different  fields like there is pipe i shows up in  many different things in mathematics e  shows up  and it's a very nice and simple formula  that relates e to the e pi  0 and 1 and you know in the internet you  can see several videos or several  articles  um that tells you that you know this has  been rated as one of the most beautiful  formulas in mathematics if not the most  beautiful formula in mathematics  um and i believe  even feignmen called it one of the most  beautiful formulas in mathematics it's  called as euler's identity
