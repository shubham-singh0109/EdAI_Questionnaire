Substituting some shooting frozen RNN,\nbut when does the clock\nokay.\nLet's start.\nOkay. So yes.\nWe will indeed discusses and 31 for today.\nI'm not an and is traveling for an academy Conference.\nHe's giving a keynote.\nHe's a keynote speaker and important conference.\nSo he, he's not here today.\nAnd he asked me if I can cover this class for him happily.\nSome of you know me and the right,\nfor others, My name is delete kiloton.\nI'm an Associate Professor in the Departments.\nMy research area is machine learning, reinforcement learning.\nAnd this semester I teach to other classes.\nHe sent to 50 machine-learning and eosin,\nthree or three random signals and system, which is probability.\nSo I see some familiar faces and I can kind of imagine what they are thinking.\nOh, no, no, you again.\nBut unfortunately, sorry for those,\nfor others. Hope you can bear with me.\nOkay, so today we will continue the discussion where processor not an and stopped.\nIn the last lecture.\nYou were discussing Fourier transform for basic signal.\nWhat is the difference between Fourier transform and Fourier Fourier series?\nYes.\nYeah, So if the signal is not periodic,\nand especially for continuous time signals,\nthe signal is not periodic.\nYou use Fourier transform.\nFourier series is, you can think for your series has a special case of Fourier transform.\nSo I believe that you know how to do Fourier transforms.\nSo if you have a signal,\nif you have a signal x of t,\nwhat is the Fourier transform of the signal?\nHow do you, how do you compute the Fourier transform of the signal?\nX of j Omega is integral from minus infinity to plus infinity,\nx of t e power minus j Omega t d\nt. And how do you get the signal back from its Fourier transform?\n1/2 pi integral minus infinity to plus infinity\nx of j Omega e power j omega t d omega\nIn one case, you are integrating over the time domain to get the frequency components.\nAnd the other case you are integrating on\nthe frequency component to get the time signal back.\nYou are played that idea to derive\nthe Fourier transform of some simple signal e power minus a t,\nu of t. You probably also did this signal.\nX of t is e power minus\na power absolute value of t. So that is a two-sided symmetric signal.\nYou also computed the Fourier transform of Delta function.\nSuppose if you are x of t,\nis delta of t,\nwhat is its Fourier transform UP our delta function as the time domain signal.\nWord is its Fourier transform.\nOne or so.\nYou need to defend that appropriately.\nOne. For what values of omega. You need to think.\nThe signal and the Fourier transform as function.\nOne signal is in the time domain,\nso that's a function of the time.\nThe Fourier transform is in another domain.\nIt's a function of watch,\nis a function of frequency.\nNow, if your function x of t is delta of t,\nits Fourier transform is actually a function of omega.\nSo if you have a function of omega,\nyou need to specify what is a value corresponding to each and every Omega.\nNow if X of t is delta of t,\nWhat is x of j Omega for different values of omega.\nThat is one for all omega.\nSo this you discuss,\nx of t is delta of t and then x of j Omega is one.\nWhat is the interpretation?\nIf you, our delta function,\nif you have a sharp spike and coming back,\nit contains frequency component from minus infinity to plus infinity.\nNow, you can, you might have observed by now that there is\na symmetry between four-year trans signal and\nFourier transform and Fourier transform and the signal.\nTo illustrate that symmetry.\nAnd to get some intuition, here,\nyou have x of t as Delta of t and its Fourier transform is constant.\nNow, imagine the scenario where you have x of j omega is delta omega.\nX of j omega is delta omega you,\nour spike at omega is equal to zero.\nWhat will be the inverse Fourier transform of that signal?\nOne. So essentially it means that you have time unlimited signal.\nYou know that, that is not realistic.\nWhy it is not realistic?\nWhy does it, why do we mean by saying that x of t\nis one from minus infinity to plus infinity.\nSo you got x of t is equal to one from minus infinity to plus infinity.\nWhat does it mean? Is it possible to produce a signal like this? No.\nOkay, That's signal has infinite energy, right?\nIt's a mathematical abstraction.\nSo does it satisfy, satisfy Parseval's theorem?\nSo probably you discuss that.\nNow, let's consider another signal.\nSo what I'm going to do is that I will go\nback to and from the node for the ease of writing.\nAnd then I will come back to the notch.\nSuppose x of j Omega is two pi delta omega minus omega naught.\nWhat is the Fourier transform of the signal?\nWhy does the inverse Fourier transform of the signal?\nHave you discussed this already in the class?\nThink he probably briefly mentioned this.\nLet's revisit this because I'm going to use this example to build some more,\nmore complicated example in today's lecture.\nHow do you draw this?\nYou have omega axis.\nThis is omega is equal to zero.\nNow, how do you,\nhow do you plot the signal?\nWhat is the signal?\nThis is a spike.\nFor what value of omega we have a spike.\nOmega is omega naught.\nSo the Sigma look like something at omega naught\nWhat is this value? To pay?\nNow, I want to understand what is a inverse Fourier transform of the signal.\nThat is why it is the time domain signal for this.\nHow do you compute that?\nX of t can write x of\nt as 1/2 pi from minus infinity to plus infinity,\nx of j Omega e power j omega t. Why does the integral with respect to,\nis it p or omega?\nOmega, right? Because you are integrating over all the frequency components.\nNow, what is the value of this integral?\nSo you are integrating from minus infinity to plus infinity of a function x of z omega.\nWhere is that function non-zero?\nOnly at omega is equal to Omega naught.\nThat is only point, the function is non-zero.\nSo everywhere else it is going to be zero.\nSo that integral, we don't need to evaluate that\nintegral at any point except that omega is equal to Omega naught.\nNow, what is the value of that function at omega is equal to Omega naught two pi.\nAnd then this integral will become a substitution of omega is equal to Omega naught.\nBecause everywhere else it is zero at Omega x of j Omega is two Pi.\nAnd then e power j omega t evaluated at omega will become omega e power j omega naught.\nSo what will you get?\nTwo pi times two pi e power j omega naught t.\nSo that is e power j omega naught t. So what does it mean?\nIf you have a fundamental frequency component, omega naught?\nAnd then you are considering the signal,\nthe complex signal e power j omega naught t,\nthat corresponds to a single frequency component in the frequency domain.\nOkay?\nSo that's probably you'll discuss that last time.\nWe're going to use this example to discuss a few other things, right?\nSo the slightly complicated example that we're going to do today's a rectangular signal.\nOkay?\nSo again, for writing and deriving,\nI will go back and between the notch.\nConsider the following signal.\nSo this is my d x of t. I want to compute\nthe Fourier transform or rect signal,\njust a square sigma.\nHow do we compute this?\nAnyone know what is the Fourier transform of this?\nHe discussed this in the class before.\nAll right? So some cases,\nrather than guessing it is just straightforward to\ncompute the Fourier transform using the equation.\nSo Fourier transform.\nSo what is x j Omega x of j Omega.\nYou integrate omega from minus infinity to plus infinity,\nx of t e power j omega t d omega\nminus z omega t d t. Now,\nnow the limits of integration is from minus infinity to plus infinity.\nBut do we really care the integral from minus infinity to plus infinity? We don't.\nWhy? Because the signal is zero\neverywhere except in this short interval from minus T1, T2 plus T1.\nSo why does the value of the signal between minus one and plus T1 one?\nSo this integral is exactly same as minus T1,\nT2 plus T1 e power minus j Omega t d t\nOkay, so now you have a integral with limits.\nLet's write down the integral of\ne power minus j Omega t d t. Then we will apply the limit.\nWhat is the integral of e power minus j omega t?\nWhy does, alright?\nYou have already done this.\nWhat is the integral of e power 80?\nOkay?\nSo we just read it in the standard integration formula.\nIntegral of e power AT is one over a e power\nAT integral e power minus j omega t is 1 hour\nminus J omega e power\nminus j omega t. So you treat this minus j omega RC or a.\nThen you will get one over\nminus j omega e power minus\nj omega t with the limits minus T1 and T1.\nNow let's apply the limits.\nWhy do we get, by applying the limit,\nkeep the minus j omega here,\nthat does not depend on B.\nThen you will get e power minus\nj Omega t1 minus e power minus j omega minus p one.\nSo that is going to be j Omega.\nOkay?\nNow I'm just using this minus sign here to just reverse this.\nSo I can write this as one over\nj Omega e power j omega t one minus e power minus j Omega t1.\nNow, is it possible to simplify this expression? Yes.\nWhy does e power j omega t?\nE power j omega t is sine omega t plus j times cos\nOmega t e power minus j omega t is sine my back.\nSorry.\nCos omega t plus j sine Omega t e power minus j omega t is\ncos omega t minus j sine Omega t. And when you subtract this, what will you get?\nMenu subtract e power j omega t minus e power minus\nj omega t. You get to j sine Omega t.\nOkay?\nNow, let's use this to simplify this.\nInstead of an arbitrary t, you have t1.\nSo what will you get there?\nI can continue.\nAgain, continue this year.\nYou will have one over j omega j\nsine sine\nomega t,\none, negative j sine\nOmega t. And then negative the integral.\nThat's what makes it. Yes. So it's\nnegative j. I'm notch.\nWhich questionnaire it. So your confusion is regarding this tip?\nAll right. Is there any issue in this? All right.\nAny questions? So what I did was there's a negative sign here.\nI use that negative sign to multiply this and then changes, right?\nSo this will become e power j omega t minus e power minus j Omega t1.\nNotice that you don't have a negative sign there.\nThen you get one over j Omega t j sine Omega t one.\nThat reduces to two sine omega t one divided by omega.\nTo simplifying, we have the signal x of t,\nwhich looks like this,\nminus T1, T2 plus T1.\nThis is one says t. Then the Fourier transform of this x of\nj Omega is two sine omega t one divided by omega.\nI want to plot this.\nHow do we plot this?\nHey, what happened to this function?\nWhen omega is very,\nvery large, it goes to zero, right?\nNow. What is the shape of this function?\nAs with respect to omega, right?\nNow, this function by itself may be a little more challenging for you to plot.\nSo I want to formulate this in terms of the sinc function.\nWhat is sin function?\nSinc x is how did you define your sinc function?\nSine pi x divided by x.\nOkay.\nSo how does that function looks like? Okay?\nDean?\nWhy does, how does the same function looks like?\nIj value of t is equal to zero.\nWhy does the value of sinc function one?\nWhen does this become?\nSo? When does this become zero again?\nIs equal to one.\nIt becomes zero again at t is equal to zero.\nAgain at t is equal to three. Okay?\nSo you can plot it like this.\nSimilarly. On the other side, the theme function.\nNow, when you go back and then look at your x of j Omega expression.\nSo this is your x of j Omega expression.\nX of j Omega is equal to two\nsine omega t one divided by omega.\nHow do I write this as a sinc function?\nYes.\nCorrect. So I want to make sure that\nit has a theme argument appropriately for the same function,\nI can write this as\ntwo times sinc sine\nomega t one divided by omega t one.\nThat T1 has to be multiplied by here to cancel this.\nThat is not enough.\nWe need one more thing that enough.\nWhat will you do now? Where does the pie com?\nSo I can write this as T2 T1 sine\nphi omega t1 divided by pi divided by omega d1\nThe last step. Yeah, this is inside the sine function. Alright?\nNow, to make it even,\nI can get this here.\nOkay?\nSo then this is in the form of sine by x, divide by x.\nAnd then I can write this us to be sinc Omega t1 divided by pi.\nSo to summarize, so now you can look at the expressions here, okay?\nTo summarize what we have been doing.\nX of j Omega is integral from minus infinity to plus infinity,\nx of t e power minus j Omega t d t. Now this signal\nis zero minus infinity to minus T1 and T1, T2 plus infinity.\nSo I just need to integrate from minus T1,\nT2 plus T1 one e power minus j Omega t d\nt. We did this integration and we got this value.\nWe read so far, okay?\nThen what you did is essentially multiplying and dividing\nby T1 and multiplying and dividing by pi.\nConvert that into a sinc function.\nConverting that to a sinc function.\nAnd you get, get this.\nSo the trans, the Fourier transform of\nthis signal is to T1 sin omega t one divided by pi.\nIf you our rectangular signal like this,\nwhich is zero everywhere and one between minus one and plus T1.\nThen the Fourier transform is to T1 sinc Omega t1 divided by pi.\nNow, if you have an expression like this in terms of sinc function,\nhow do you plot that sinc function?\nWe know that. Okay? We know that when omega is equal to zero,\nwhat is the value of sinc function one?\nWe know that the sin function has this nice oscillatory behavior,\nrather a damping oscillatory behavior.\nRight? Now. To plot it correctly,\nwe need to exactly specify when does it touches zero.\nIf the signal sine sinc Omega T1 divided by pi.\nWhat are the values of omega at which this function is zero?\nHow do we compute that?\nWhat are the values of the function at which it is serum?\nPardon?\nAll integer values 123456 minus 123456.\nSo the first time this function touches zero is when the argument that becomes one.\nSo when will that argument becomes one?\nThat is, for what value of omega that argument will become one.\nWhen omega is equal to Pi divided by T1 omega times t1 divided by will become one.\nSo when omega is equal to Pi divided by T1,\nthat sinc function is think of one that becomes zero.\nWhen then we know that it is just the multiplication of this fundamental frequency,\nphi divided by T1.\nAnd when omega is two pi divided by T1,\nit becomes sink of two omega three phi divided by T1,\nit becomes single three,\nthen it is zero.\nSo that is oscillatory behavior.\nQuestions, comments.\nIs this derivation clear?\nWe are going to build on this for the next few examples.\nSo if you have any questions,\nthis is the time to ask. Is that clear?\nOkay. Alright.\nThank you.\nOkay.\nNow, why did we discuss we\nconsider a signal of this form, rectangular signal.\nAnd we consider the Fourier transform of that,\nand we got the sinc function.\nNow, the magnitude is one.\nThe magnitude is one.\nSuppose I change the magnitude to a.\nWhy do we, the Fourier transform?\nWill the shape change?\nSo rather, this is a value between minus p,\nn plus p and zero everywhere else,\nI'm interested in computing the Fourier transform of that.\nWill it change?\nI just need to multiply by a because the fundamental shape of the signal is not changing.\nWhy does induce any,\nany physical and non-physical, any real-world intuition?\nIf you are taking a signal and multiplying that by a constant,\nso your own original signal,\nx of t, you compute the Fourier transform.\nNow you have a new signal, y of t,\nwhich is a times x of t,\nand you compute the Fourier transform of y of t, y of t omega.\nHow will these two signals,\nthe Fourier transform relate to?\nIn particular, will the Fourier transform look different?\nAnd how will it look different?\nMore precisely, will the shape change?\nThe shape will not change.\nYou can easily show that.\nConsider computing the Fourier transform.\nIn the first case, you have x of t e power minus j Omega t d t. In the second case,\nyou are a times x of t e power minus j omega t. You take the a outside,\nthen rushed is the Fourier transform of x.\nOne intuition is that suppose you are playing\nsome music with a complicated musical instrument.\nEverything from the low-frequency bass kind\nof thing and a very high-frequency electronic music.\nOkay? But you want to listen,\nsuppose there's some background noise and you just wanted to increase\nthe volume of your earphone or the surrounding system, or the speakers.\nYou just increase the volume.\nYou don't expect the music to change.\nThe frequency will remain the same, right?\nIt just that the magnitude at which you are hearing will change.\nThe frequencies will remain the same.\nNow, let's push that idea.\nSo what I have been telling you is that if I'm\nmultiplying that signal by a constant value,\nthen everything will remain the same.\nBut let's assume that I'm multiplying that signal by a number.\nBut that number is not a constant.\nThat number is a quantity that depends on the signal.\nIn particular, I'm going to consider a new signal.\nI'm going to consider x of t is one over square root of\ntwo T one when t is between minus one and plus one and zero otherwise.\nSo this is exactly the rectangular signal that we have been discussing.\nMinus D1 plus D1.\nSame rectangular signal.\nBut what is the amplitude of the signal?\nWhat is the value? One over square root of two T1?\nWhy does the energy of the signal?\nWhat is the energy of the signal?\nHow do you compute the energy of a signal?\nMinus infinity to plus infinity,\nx squared t d t.\nAnd what is energy?\nYou take the square.\nYou have, you have you\ndiscuss that computing energy or the signal that you're trying the class, right?\nOkay, so computing the energy of the signal is okay.\nIf I want to compute the energy of the signal,\nI take minus infinity to plus infinity x square t d t. But for this signal,\nthe signal is non-zero between minus one and plus T1 only.\nAnd what is the value of x square t between this interval?\nThe value of x square t between that interval is one over square root,\none over square root of two T,\none whole square d t.\nOkay?\nSo that is minus T1, T2 plus T1,\n1 hour to t1 d t. Now 1 hour to T1 is a constant.\nI can take that outside 1 hour to t1.\nAnd the integral is minus T1,\nT2 plus T1 d t. Now what is the value of this integral?\nWhat is the integral of one d, d, d, Okay?\nSo now 1 hour to t1 t with limits T1 and minus T1.\nAnd you will get one over T2, T1,\nT1 minus minus p1,\nand that is equal to one.\nSo what we did was we just consider the same rectangular signal,\nbut made it a unit and artistically need a unit energy signal.\nNow I am interested in computing the Fourier transform of this unit and, or the signal.\nHow do you compute that? You can imagine that it is going to be exactly the same steps.\nGoing to be exactly the same step,\nbecause anyway, you are integrating between minus one and plus T1.\nThe only difference is that you will have an additional factor outside, okay?\nThat I will leave that to a self exercise.\nAnd you can, after computing the integral,\njust like we did in the previous problem,\nyou can show that the Fourier transform of that signal is how the following form.\nSquare root of two T1 sinc Omega t1 divided by pi.\nEarlier.\nIf the magnitude is one,\nthe Fourier transform was to T1 omega t1 divided by pi.\nHere, if the magnitude is scaled to one over square root of two T1,\nthen the magnitude is scale here also.\nAnd you will get square root of two T one sin omega t when divided by five.\nNow, consider, why are we doing this?\nBecause we already done this.\nYou already did the same problem in the previous setting.\nWhy does the motivation behind this, okay?\nMartin and motivation.\nThis essentially will give you how you can kind of\nstretch a signal in time domain and to see the effect in the frequency domain.\nAnd in another words,\nyou can shrink the signal in time domain.\nAnd you can see the effect on the frequency domain.\nLet's assume that T1 is shrinking.\nT1 is going to zero.\nWhat happens to x of t?\nThis is x of t\nThis is x of z omega.\nWhen T1 goes to zero,\nwhat happens to what happens to x of t?\nY1 goes to zero, shrinks, Yes.\nThe magnitude approaches infinity,\nthe spread approaches zero.\nAnd what does that function at delta function?\nSo when T1 goes to zero,\nand T1 goes to, goes to zero, x of t,\nthat signal will approach us a delta, delta function.\nNow look at x of j omega.\nWhat happens when even goes to zero?\nWhat happens when T1 goes to zero?\nWhen will the fast-growing happens?\nSo currently the crossing\nhappened much grossing is the first-time seeing function better.\nZero happens by divided by T1.\nSo if y1 is equal to one,\nthat is buying, if T1 is half,\nthat is two-pi evenness, 0.1,\nthat is ten by B1 is ten power minus three,\nthat is ten power three times Pi.\nAnd you can see that as Stephen goes to zero, the first closing,\nthe first-time sync that's just zero,\nis kind of going further, further, further apart.\nIn the limit, what will happen?\nThis will become a flat signals.\nThat should not be surprising because in the previous class,\nyou derive that if your x of t,\nif you are x of t,\nis this delta function,\nthen x of j omega will become a flat sigma one.\nOkay? So we just wanted to derive that correctly.\nNow you see that there is a trick that we played,\nwhich is making the energy of the signal constant.\nBecause if you keep an arbitrary a and then scale T1,\nthen the shape is difficult to interpret.\nOkay? Okay.\nNow,\nsummarizing what we just did.\nHow a signal D one\nminus D1 plus D1 is the Fourier transform of the signal.\nIschemia shape. Not quite.\nThis is a rectangular signal.\nWhat function is that?\nA sync function.\nOkay. The specific form will be to\nT1 sinc Omega t1 divided by pi.\nWe saw this, we discussed this.\nWe spent more than enough time on this.\nBut let's use that intuition to solve another problem.\nOkay? So this is X of t omega.\nSuppose I have another problem.\nMy x of j Omega is\nthe signal\nX\nof\nt omega is that rectangular signal that M inverse.\nWhat will be the corresponding time domain signal?\nInducing? This is yes.\nBut there won't be\nlike the coefficient in the interval\nIt'll be a rebel,\nit will be a sinc function.\nSo the first thing that we should infer is that we will,\nwe will calculate the exact form of the sinc function.\nBut the reason that we're doing this, many other things.\nOne thing is to emphasize that there is\nan inherent symmetry in the time domain signal and its Fourier transform.\nAnd the corresponding looking frequency domain signal\nand the corresponding time-domain signal.\nJust by looking at the symmetry.\nOkay? I can guess that. Okay.\nI'm going to guess that\nthe inverse Fourier transform of this rectangle rectangular frequency domain signal\nis going to be sum V times sinc a p.\nThis is my Gus.\nOkay? We just need to find what is the value of b and what is the value of a.\nBut I can guess that\nthe time domain signal corresponding to\nthis frequency domain signal is going to be a sync function.\nLet's verify that.\nLet's verify that I want to compute x of t by inverse Fourier transform.\nSo that is 1/2 pi omega from minus infinity to plus infinity,\nx of j Omega e power j omega t and d omega.\nNow, this is my x of t omega.\nSo I don't need to take the integral from minus omega two plus omega minus omega,\nomega from minus infinity to plus infinity,\nI just need to take integral from minus w to plus w.\nSo I keep this 1/2 pi,\nintegrate this from minus w to plus w. In that interval,\nx of j Omega is equal to one.\nSo I just tried one and e power j omega t and d omega.\nOkay? Now take the integral and apply the limit.\nWhat is the integral of e power j omega t with respect to omega?\nWhy does the integral of e power j omega t with respect to omega,\nyou treat it as e power x. Integral of e power x is one over a, e power x.\nWhat is a here?\nJT, right?\nSo I get 1/2 pi 1/2 pi\none over j times t e power j omega t,\nwith the limits plus w and minus w. Now I play the limits\n1/2 pi one over\nt e power j w t minus e\npower j w j minus WT.\nWhat is this quantity?\nWhat is that quantity?\nWhat is e power JWT cos w t plus j sine w t. What is e power minus the AWT?\nCos w t minus j sine w t. Subtracted,\nthe cosine term will cancel.\nOnly the sine term will remain.\nAnd you will get 1/2 pi one over JT.\nYou will get two j sine w t,\nso that j and j will cancel.\nAnd two and two will cancel.\nAnd you will get one over pi sine w t divided by b.\nOkay? Now, I need to write this in the form of a sync function.\nHow do you write this in the form of a sync function?\nSo first I need to make sure that the numerator and the denominator matches.\nSo in the denominator,\nI'm missing a term w.\nSo I multiply and divide by that w. So I get w\ndivided by pi sine w t divided by w\nOkay, now I can make this a sinc function.\nWhat is a form of the sinc function?\nNow, this is w divided\nby Pi sinc function.\nLet's add one more small scaling.\nI need to divide this by pi and multiply this by Pi.\nAnd need to consider this as my x psi get phi, sorry,\nsink of you get to think\nof WE DO T divided by pi.\nSo the inverse Fourier transform of that rectangular signal is indeed\na sinc function with the value W over Pi,\nsince W T divided by pi.\nNow if I wanted to plot this function, okay?\nSo this is x of j Omega.\nX of j omega is w over Pi.\nThink, sink.\nWhy does the value of my bad?\nThis is\nx of\nt.\nSo\nafter all this calculation,\nwe got the time-domain signal,\nw over Pi sinc w t divided by pi.\nOkay, I wanted to plot this.\nIt looks like a function.\nWhy does the x-axis here time?\nBecause this is a time domain signal.\nThis is t, this is the value of zero.\nWhat is the value of x of t when t is equal to zero?\nW over pi.\nBecause the value of sin function at zero is one.\nSo this value is w over pi.\nThen is, what is the value of t corresponding to the first Crossing?\nCrossing happens when when the sync argument is equal to one,\nwhen will the arguments to the sin function becomes one?\nIn other words, why does the value of t,\nwhen the argument becomes one?\nThat is by, divided by w.\nOkay?\nAnd then the second crossing happens at two pi divided W, etc.\nOkay?\nNow, you can verify that in your knowledge,\nafter all this calculation,\nthis is where we started from and we computed our inverse Fourier transform.\nThat is a sinc function.\nTake 1 minute break just to for you to clear your head.\nAnd then we will continue a few more things.\nYes. If you have any questions,\nlet me know in the graph that I drew or again,\nI can show you this graph.\nThis graph. How do we get this?\nW over pi sin W T divided by pi.\nSo zeros happens when sinc function is one,\nare the arguments are in digital.\nYou just need to find the values of t when the,\nwhen the total argument of the sin function as integers\nOkay, alright,\nnow, if you have gone through the course material,\nyou will see that there is a fairly big table of\nthe sum of the Fourier transform equations,\nformulas and things that you need to, you need to study.\nProse or not. And we'll tell you more details about that.\nBut what we're going to do next is proving\nsome interesting properties of Fourier transform.\nWe already know what is Fourier transform is.\nWe already know how to compute the inverse Fourier transform.\nWhy do we care about properties?\nJust for giving you more homeworks and assignments and\ngiving you questions in the exam. Maybe something more.\nSo we will see that sometimes though we define Fourier transform,\nwe know how to compute the Fourier transform,\nand then we know how to compute the inverse Fourier transform.\nSome signals very difficult to compute.\nHow many of you have this real passion of solving very, very complicated intervals.\nIntegrals. Yeah, some of you may have,\nI can solve, I like solving integrals,\nbut if I can avoid that,\nokay, I would prefer that route.\nFourier transform is completely about doing integration for complicated signals.\nSo any trig that we can use to reduce that complicated integral symbol, symbol integrals.\nAnd saw that symbol integral somehow manipulate\nthe result to compute the Fourier transform of complicated signal.\nLife is much, much happier.\nSo what we're going to do is we're going to explore some properties of Fourier transform.\nThen use that properties to simplify\ncomputing the Fourier transform and inverse Fourier transform or complicated signal.\nThe first property that we're going to make use of is the linearity of Fourier transform.\nConsider the signal x of t.\nLet's assume that it has a Fourier transform of x of t omega.\nI know this current era,\nthe signal x of t as a rectangle signal.\nI know the Fourier transform of this.\nNow.\nSuppose I have another signal,\nand suppose I know the Fourier transform of this y of d Omega.\nNow I have a new signal, z of t,\nwhich is x of t plus y of\nt. What is the Fourier transform of z of t?\nZ of z omega?\nIs there a way to express the Fourier Transform of the signal z in\nterms of the Fourier transform of x and Fourier transform of y.\nIs it straightforward, obvious.\nWhy does your guess?\nWhat is your this one?\nGuess?\nAnyone?\nIt's a combination.\nWhat kind of combination?\nIs it just multiplication,\nsummation or weighted sum. Just summation.\nOkay. Why does the intuition?\nIntuition should directly come from your experience in doing integral?\nLet's quickly verify this, okay?\nSo I am interested in computing z of d Omega.\nI'm interested in Z of j Omega,\nwhich is minus infinity to plus infinity,\nz of t e power minus j Omega t d t. Now what is my z of t?\nThat is minus infinity to plus infinity x of t,\ny of t e power minus j Omega t d\nt. This is from basic calculus.\nThis is x of t e power minus j Omega t d t plus,\nminus infinity to plus infinity y of t e power\nminus j Omega t d t. Why does this value?\nThat is the Fourier transform of x.\nSo that is x of j omega\nOkay, And what is this value?\nThat is the Fourier transform of y,\nthat is y of j Omega.\nSo if x as a Fourier transform of x of z omega y\nhas a Fourier transform of y of d Omega and z is equal to the sum of these two signals.\nAnd then the Fourier transform of z of t is x over j Omega plus y of t Omega.\nSeems straightforward.\nOkay? Now let's see why do we care about this, right?\nFor that, I'm going to give you an example.\nLet's compute the Fourier transform of that signal.\nOkay? This is my x of t symbol tower like signal.\nWhat is the Fourier transform of the signal?\nNow you see the possible complication.\nOkay? So this signal is zero,\nless than minus three, three-half.\nAnd zero for greater than three half.\nIt is non-zero between this interval.\nNon-zero between this interval.\nBut it's not as nice rectangular signal.\nSo you cannot just do an easy integration.\nNow, you see that if you just wanted to compute the Fourier transform of this signal,\nyou have to go to your,\nfor some people happy memory for some people that\ndreaded memory of integration by parts, right?\nYou need to integrate from minus three-half to one-half according to one value.\nThen you need to integrate from minus l to plus one plus half.\nThen you need another integral from half to three-half.\nThen you have three different limits to a play.\nCompute the limit, simplify that,\nand you will get a signal.\nSeems complicated.\nNow imagine if you are\nvery complicated continuous time signal where you need to compute the Fourier transform.\nNow, can we simplify this?\nIn particular, I would like to ask you to think,\nhow do you use this property?\nIf you are to signal x of t and y of t.\nAnd then you consider the sum of these two signals.\nThen the Fourier transform or\nthe Fourier transform of the sum of the signal is equal to sum of the Fourier transform.\nHow do you use that property?\nYes. Very good.\nOkay, that's indeed what we are going to do.\nSo I have going to\ndefine as signal like this.\nThis is minus three-half, two plus three-half.\nAnd another signal, minus half to plus half.\nOkay? I'm going to call this signal as x of t,\nand I'm going to call this signal as phi of t. And I'm going to\ncall this signal as c of t. From this figure,\nit is very clear that you are Z of t is x of\nt plus phi of t. Now why does the Fourier transform of z of t,\nZ of j omega is x of j Omega plus y of d Omega.\nWhy does x of j Omega?\nIt's a sinc function.\nWe discussed the formula for that.\nYou may not remember that because we just did it.\nBut inward. And to think about what it is,\nessentially, you need to understand that there are zeros.\nPatching is by you our T1.\nOkay? So it's very easy to define that.\nSimilarly, y of j Omega Pi our T1.\nSo essentially it's going to be three-half, right?\nAnd just compute that, add that up.\nAnd that is what we are discussing here.\nOkay?\nIf you are a signal\nT and t over three,\nslightly different from what I, what I explained.\nThen, the Fourier transform of this signal\nis the Fourier transform of the first signal plus Fourier transform of the second signal.\nFourier transform of the first signal is a sin function.\nWith the first zero crossing edge.\nOmega is equal to half and omega is equal to.\nAnd the Fourier transform of the second signal, right?\nT over three is another thing function with the first zero crossing 2/3.\nAnd the Fourier transform of this staircase or the tower like signal,\nis the sum of two sinc function.\nSo that simplifies the entire problem.\nNow, I will apply this, okay,\nI'll play this for a simple setting to to\nshow why it is the Fourier transform of a single since\nvoyage and a Fourier transform of a single cosine signal.\nConsider the signal x of t\ncos omega naught t. I want to compute the x sub j Omega for this.\nNow can be relayed cos omega naught t to some signal whose Fourier transform we know.\nIn the beginning of this class,\nwe consider a signal.\nThe beginning of this class we consider a signal which is further away.\nWe consider a signal x of t is e power j omega naught t. If,\nif your x of t is e power j omega naught t,\nthen its Fourier transform,\nx of j Omega is two pi delta omega minus omega naught.\nNow I want to make use this property and find the Fourier transform of cos omega\nnaught t. I want\nto write x of t,\nx of t, y of t,\nz of t. In such a way that y of t and z of t looks like this.\nHow do I do that?\nI can write this as e power j omega naught t plus e power minus j omega naught t\ndivided by two e power j omega naught t is cos omega naught t plus sine omega\nnaught t e power minus j omega\nnaught t is cos omega naught t minus j sine omega naught t.\nAnd if you add this to,\nthe sine part will cancel,\nyou will get two cosine component and you divide that.\nAnd this is what you get.\nNow, since x of t has this form,\nwhat is x of j Omega?\nX of z omega will be half\ntimes y of j Omega plus half times Z of j Omega.\nWhy does value of d Omega?\nWhat is y of t omega Delta function?\nAt what frequency?\nWe are looking at the Fourier transform of e power j omega naught t.\nWe already derived this in the beginning of this lecture.\nAnd this is it here.\nThe Fourier transform of e power j omega naught t is a delta function\nat omega is equal to Omega naught with the magnitude two pi.\nSo this is half two pi delta omega minus\nomega naught plus half.\nNow I have a signal z of j.\nWhy does the Fourier transform of that?\nIt is also delta.\nDelta function at frequency.\nIf I have a signal x of t is e power j omega naught t.\nIts Fourier transform is two pi delta omega minus omega naught.\nIt essentially mean that I Howard delta function at the frequency omega naught.\nNow if I have signal e power minus j omega naught t,\nits Fourier transform is another delta function at
