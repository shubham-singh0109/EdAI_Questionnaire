 we're going to quickly talk about  functions of a complex variable  and suppose z is a complex number  or z say it's a it's a complex variable  we say that f of z  is a function of z  if  f of z takes a unique value for a given  z in other words for one value of z  you cannot have two different values of  f of z  if that's the case you have only one  value of f of z for a given z then we  say that f of z is a function of a  complex variable  so there are many files i'll give you a  few examples of functions that you may  have seen before  so for example  the magnitude of the complex number z  is a function of z because  for for example if you have z is 2 plus  3 i  then  this function is simply  square root of 4 plus 9 which is square  root of 13. so that's just a fixed value  and and remember when you take square  roots when we talk about magnitudes  we're always defining it to be just the  positive value of the square root so  then it takes a unique value  so another one  could be  the angle  of z or the arg of argument of z  right  so that would of course  be  in this case the inverse tangent of 3  over 2 but since 2 plus 3 i lies in the  first quadrant the value that lies  between  0 and pi over 2  so the theta that lies between  0 and pi over 2  since we define it that way so that is a  unique value for every value of z  right  on other examples  so you can have z to the n  where n is an integer  so 1 2 3 so on and so forth and these  are all  functions because  you know if i if i if we say n is 2 for  example  you know if if f of z is z squared  then  if i take f of 1 plus 2 i  that is simply 1 plus 2 i  squared and that's a unique complex  number right you can evaluate it and  that's just going to give you some  number  however  when n is not an integer f of z is not a  function  right so for example  when n is let's say one third  then f of z is equal to z raised to n  which is z raised to one third  we have already seen  that there are three values of  there are three values such that when  you take them to power 3 will give you  any given value of z so z raised to 1 3  is not a unique value  so by itself it's not really a function  if you want to make it a function we  have to define one of these three values  as the principal value and typically  what you can do is you can simply define  the one for which you are not adding any  integer power of 2 pi to the exponent as  the principal value in in that case you  can make that as a function but you  would have to make it explicit  and say that you're looking at the  principal value  okay  now there is one particular function  which  repeatedly comes in the course  and that is the function  e to the z  where z is a complex number  so suppose z is the complex number  given by sigma plus j omega let's say  so the real part is sigma and the  imaginary part is omega then what is e  to the z  so f of z is equal to e to the z  is given by e to the sigma plus j omega  which you can write as e to the sigma  times  e to the j  omega now sigma is a real number e to  the sigma is some real number  and e to the j omega  we can interpret that using euler's  formula and write that  as cosine omega plus j times sine omega  so f of z in this case  would then be e to the sigma times  cosine omega plus j sine omega so that's  just another complex number  which is  in cartesian form it is just e to the  sigma cosine omega plus j times e to the  sigma sine omega  okay so this is a function that you  might see  a few times in the course
