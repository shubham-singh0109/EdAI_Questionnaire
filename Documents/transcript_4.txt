 have you ever wondered  why  roots of polynomials  with the real coefficients  always occur in conjugate pairs  well if you're probably not notice this  let's start with  the so the roots of a quadratic equation  let's say that you have a quadratic  equation x squared minus 2x plus 5 is  equal to 0  what are the roots of this quadratic  equation well you know that the two  roots  are  minus b plus square root of b squared  minus 4az over 2a and minus b minus  square root of b squared minus 4ac over  2a right and you notice that they are  complex conjugates so for example in  this case it's 2 plus  square root of  4 minus 20  over 2  and the second root  is  2 minus  square root of 4 minus 20  over 2.  so clearly this is  1  plus  j 2  and this is 1 minus  2 j  so they are complex conjugates of each  other  right  and you will see that this is true for  any quadratic equation which has real  coefficients  and it turns out this is true  in more generality in the sense if you  have  let's say you have a cubic equation  instead of a so for example  let's say you have a equation which is x  cubed  minus 4x squared  plus 6x  minus 4  is equal to 0. and if you compute the  roots of this equation it turns out that  the roots  are  2  1 plus j  and 1 minus j and you can see that these  two these two  roots occur as conjugate pairs and what  i'm going to show in this video is  that for any polynomial  not just a quadratic or a cubic  as long as the coefficients in the  polynomial are real  roots will always have to occur in  complex conjugate pairs  okay  so  so here is the proof of this curious  fact so let's say we have  a polynomial  and i'm going to call the polynomial  as  x to the n  plus  a n minus 1  x to the n minus 1  plus so on and so forth until a 1 x  plus a naught  and let's say that this  the equation is that this polynomial is  equal to 0.  now if this polynomial is equal to 0  then what must be true  is that we should be able to factor this  polynomial  into  its roots  right so so so let's say that this  polynomial will call this as p of x  so we know that  p of x  factors  into the product of its roots so we can  write this polynomial as x minus r 1  times x minus r 2 so on and so forth  until x minus r n  so what we're going to do is we're going  to conjugate both sides so let's take  the complex conjugate on the left side  and on the right side  so what do i get when i take the complex  conjugate on the left side  what we are going to get is  conjugate of x  raised to n  plus the conjugate of a n minus 1  times x conjugate raised to n minus 1  plus the conjugate of a1 times  conjugate of x  plus the conjugate of a naught on the  left hand side  on the right hand side  we're going to get  x conjugate minus  r 1 conjugate  x conjugate minus r  2 conjugate so on and so forth  until  x conjugate minus r n conjugate  now what we know is that these a's are  real  we don't know anything about these roots  r1 through rns but we know that the a's  are real  so what does it mean to take the  conjugate of something that's real so if  i take the conjugate of a real number i  need to get the same real number again  so the conjugate of a  all these coefficients  is the same as the coefficients  themselves so i can remove  the conjugate  from these coefficients  okay  now  i'm just going to call x conjugate  as y  and now you will notice that you get y n  plus a n minus 1 times y n minus 1  plus so on and so forth until a 1 times  y  plus a naught  is equal to y minus r r1 conjugate  times y minus r 2 conjugate  so on and so forth until y minus rn  conjugate  okay  now notice that y is just an  indeterminate right x and y's they're  just variables so if i look at these two  equations  you can see that these two equations are  exactly the same so i could just replace  y with x and i would have exactly the  same equation here  and what that tells me  is that  or maybe we'll just do it  and we'll see some so let's say this is  this means  so notice that these two equations are  exactly the same  the first and last equations are exactly  the same  but on the right hand side the roots of  this equation are r1 through rn whereas  the roots of this equation are r1  conjugate through rn conjugate so that  tells you  if r1 is the root of this equation r1  conjugate is also a root of this  equation  in other words roots occur in complex  conjugate pairs  of course these conjugates are not new  roots so what this just tells you is  one of these other roots here must have  been the conjugate of r1 and one of  these other rules here is the conjugate  of r2 so on and so forth  now this itself is not something that  you might really see a lot as an  undergraduate in electrical engineering  it is just a curious fact and you know  if you ever study finite fields  um  later on  um  it might help you understand conjugates  in finite fields a bit easier
